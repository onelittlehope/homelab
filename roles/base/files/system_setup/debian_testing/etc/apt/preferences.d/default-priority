# When multiple Apt repositories are enabled, a package can exist in several
# of them. To know which one should be installed, Apt assigns priorities to
# packages. The default is 500.
#
# - If the packages have the same priority, the package with a higher version
#   number (most recent) wins.
# - If packages have different priorities, the one with the higher priority
#   wins.
#
# Pinning allows changing priorities for only some packages/repositories.
#
# To view the priority of a specific package, use:
#
#    apt-cache policy my_package_name
#
# To view the global priority for each Apt source (repository):
#
#    apt-cache policy
#
